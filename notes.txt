The data I attached above is for my song recommendation microservice. I manually did the "Bohemian Rhapsody" one at the top, which contains the song recommendations and an explanation of why those songs are considered recommendations.

Can you do the same for the rest of the items on this list? I.e., keep the same recommendations but create an "explanation" key for each. Please generate the full file for me.
